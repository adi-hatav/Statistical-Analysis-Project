### Statistical-Analysis-Project
#### Adi Hatav and Tamar Dufour Dror, 2023

The data file we used (CVD_cleaned.csv) was taken from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset.


This project consists of 5 different parts during which different statistical methods for data analysis were applied. Each section focused on the following topics:

Part1 - Initial analysis of the data.

Part2 - Statistical inference: estimation and hypothesis testing: In this part, we analyzed the relationship between depression and BMI among women aged 18-64.

Part3 - linear regression and logistic regression: In this part, we analyzed the effect of depression, fried potato consumption and BMI on the respondentsâ€™ green vegetables consumption, and the effect of diabetes, smoking history and BMI on heart diseases.

Part4 - Bootstrap method: In this part, we returned to the first question from part 3, and we used bootstrap-based methods to investigate our question.

 Part5 - Baysian inference and missing data: In this part, we returned to the question from part 2, and we used bayesian statistics to answer it. In the second section in this part, we created a new database from the height, smoking history, alcohol consumption and weight features. Then, we then removed values from the weight column in a non-random manner, and we tried to estimate those missing values.
